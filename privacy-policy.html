            to other websites. We will use this information to try and make our
            websites and other sites that you visit more relevant to your

            Regent Bali Canggu companies and carefully selected third parties,
            for this purpose. We work with technology partners to support our
            websites and to provide you with relevant information about the
            products and services of websites and on affiliated sites or sites
            within the advertising networks we work with. We may use cookies on

            functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made
            on the websites so as to provide you with a more enhanced user
            experience by delivering content specific to your

            that are required for the administration and operation of our
            websites. Some cookies that we use are necessary for our websites to
            function properly and to enable you to move around the websites and
            use its features.</p><p>Third Party Cookies because Regent Bali
            Canggu has a strong presence on various social networks, we try and
            make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content
            is popular on those networks. We add buttons to allow people to
            easily share to those networks. We also use Facebook to power some
            of the chat functionality on the websites. When we include these
            social ‘plugins’, it gives those sites the flexibility to use their
            own cookies. They can’t read any cookies we set from our websites,
            and we can’t read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same
            kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the websites,
            and it also lets them know whether you’re logged into their site.
            For example, if you’re logged in to Facebook, and want to converse
            via the chat widget, you can do that straight away without having to
            log in again – we never know whether you’re logged in or not, as you
            communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our
            websites. Other sites and services (including, for example,
            advertising networks, providers of external services like web
