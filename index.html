            <h3>REGENT BALI CANGGU</h3><h2 class="heading-lg">A coastal haven
            where Bali's spirit unravels</h2><p>On Canggu Beach, surfers are
            silhouetted in the morning sun, boards under arms ready to take on
            Bali's famous reef breaks. Watching the waves, listening to the call
            of the Indian Ocean, you might catch the scent of incense or the
            melody of the gamelan emitting from Pura Batu Mejan, a centuries old
            sea temple set on rock as black as jet. A blessed way to begin each
            day.</p><p></p><p></p><p><div style="max-width:25rem; margin:auto;
