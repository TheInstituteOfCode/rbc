Watching the  waves, listening to the call of the Indian Ocean, you might catch the  scent of incense or the melody of the gamelan emitting from Pura Batu  Mejan, a centuries old sea temple set on rock as black as jet. A blessed way to begin each day.</p><div style="max-width:25rem; margin:auto; margin-bottom:2rem;"><h3 class="mt-8">A METICULOUSLY CURATED RESORT DESERVES AN INTENTIONALLY CRAFTED WEBSITE.
